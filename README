Style-aware Mid-level Representation README
-------------------------------------------


1. Using the code

There are 2 main scripts:

a) "main.m": mines style-sensitive mid-level visual elements and establishes correspondences across all decades.
b) "viewDets.m": displays the mined mid-level visual elements and discovered correspondences.



2. Notes

The code assumes that the Historical Car Dataset and random background Flickr images have been downloaded (http://ladoga.graphics.cs.cmu.edu/yjlee22/web/iccv2013Style/download_data.html). 
Please change the input and output directories in "setParameters.m" appropriately.
The code can take several days to run on a single machine.  It is best to run it on a cluster.
